# Shank Strategy Ops — Engagement Model  
**How We Enter, Execute, Protect Leverage, and Exit Cleanly**

---

## TL;DR (Internal)

We do not take work just because it is interesting or paid.

Every engagement must:
- Start clean
- Stay bounded
- Deliver real outcomes
- Increase leverage (not just workload)
- End cleanly

Consulting is an entry vector — not the default destination.

---

## Purpose

This engagement model exists to ensure that Shank Strategy Ops:

- Avoids grind-heavy consulting traps
- Preserves execution quality
- Maintains authority and clarity
- Converts fixing into position, leverage, and optionality
- Exits engagements without dependency or resentment

If an engagement increases effort without increasing leverage, it is capped or declined.

---

## Engagement Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Outcomes before activity**  
   Work is defined by results, not hours, decks, or visibility.

2. **Bounded by design**  
   Every engagement has explicit entry, exit, and success criteria.

3. **Authority precedes execution**  
   If authority is unclear, outcomes will be unclear.

4. **Leverage matters**  
   We do not accept work that permanently trades leverage for busyness.

5. **Shared accountability**  
   Client and firm responsibilities are explicit and enforced.

6. **Simplicity over ceremony**  
   Governance exists to enable speed, not slow it down.

## Standard Engagement Phases

### Phase 0: Fit & Readiness Check  
**Purpose:** Decide whether this work should happen at all.

**Activities:**
- Problem framing discussion
- Executive sponsorship confirmation
- Decision authority validation
- Access and data readiness check

**Outputs:**
- Go / No-Go decision
- Clear problem statement
- Initial definition of success

**Rule:**  
If authority, intent, or readiness is missing, the engagement does not proceed.

---

### Phase 1: Operational Reality Diagnostic  
**Purpose:** Establish a shared, unsanitized view of reality.

**Activities:**
- Operational and system diagnostics
- KPI and reporting noise analysis
- Decision flow and ownership mapping
- Constraint and entropy identification

**Outputs:**
- Executive-level findings
- Prioritized issues tied to real impact
- Clear articulation of what is actually broken (and what is not)

**Rule:**  
No solutioning before reality is agreed.

---

### Phase 1.5: Leverage & Trajectory Assessment (Internal Gate)  
**Purpose:** Decide what kind of relationship this engagement should become — if any.

This phase is internal to Shank Strategy Ops.

**We explicitly assess:**
- Does this engagement increase our positional leverage?
- Does it create optionality beyond fee-for-service?
- Are we gaining authority, trust, or embedded influence — or just more responsibility?

**Outcomes:**
- Proceed to Phase 2
- Cap scope and exit cleanly
- Decline continuation

**Rule:**  
If leverage does not increase, duration must be constrained.

---

### Phase 2: Design & Commitment  
**Purpose:** Convert insight into executable commitment.

**Activities:**
- Target-state operating design
- Execution roadmap definition
- Ownership, cadence, and escalation setup
- Risk and dependency mapping

**Outputs:**
- Agreed execution plan
- Defined success metrics
- Explicit client commitments (decisions, resources, behaviors)

**Rule:**  
No execution begins without ownership and commitment.

---

### Phase 3: Execution & Stabilization  
**Purpose:** Deliver change that holds under real operating conditions.

**Activities:**
- Hands-on execution support
- Decision facilitation and escalation
- Issue resolution
- Performance tracking against defined metrics

**Outputs:**
- Measurable operational improvement
- Reduced entropy and noise
- Stabilized systems, processes, and rhythms

**Execution Posture:**  
Shank Strategy Ops may lead, co-lead, or advise — depending on authority granted.

---

### Phase 4: Transition & Exit  
**Purpose:** Ensure durability without dependency.

**Activities:**
- Knowledge and capability transfer
- Process and decision documentation
- Final outcome review
- Optional next-phase recommendations

**Outputs:**
- Client-owned operating rhythm
- Clear post-engagement state
- Explicit disengagement

**Rule:**  
If the client still needs us for the same problem, the engagement failed.

---

## Execution Kill Triggers (Internal Guardrail)

Even clean engagements can rot. We do not “push through” indefinitely.

We pause, cap, or exit if any of the following persist:

- **Authority erosion:** Decision rights disappear after commitment.
- **Sponsor disengagement:** Executive sponsor stops showing up or protecting decisions.
- **Chronic deferral:** The same decisions are repeatedly deferred without cause.
- **Scope creep without leverage:** Work expands while authority or optionality does not.
- **Accountability without control:** We are held responsible for outcomes we cannot influence.
- **Access denial:** Data/people access becomes gated, sanitized, or delayed enough to block outcomes.

**Response:**  
We name the trigger, propose a corrective action with a deadline, and if not resolved, we exit cleanly.

## Engagement Models Offered

### Fixed-Scope Projects
**Use when:**
- Scope is clear
- Outcomes are defined
- Duration must be controlled

**Typical uses:**
- Diagnostics
- Operational resets
- Targeted execution interventions

---

### Retainer-Based Advisory
**Use when:**
- Authority exists but priorities evolve
- Leadership needs continuity, not capacity
- Scope guardrails are enforced

**Guardrail:**  
Retainers are reviewed regularly for leverage vs. load.

---

### Fractional Executive Leadership
**Use when:**
- Temporary authority is required
- Outcomes demand decision ownership
- There is a defined exit condition

**Guardrail:**  
Fractional roles must increase control and optionality — not recreate past grind.

---

## What Shank Strategy Ops Is Not

- Not staff augmentation
- Not open-ended advisory
- Not execution without authority
- Not strategy without ownership

If a client needs bodies without accountability, the engagement is declined.

---

## Client Responsibilities (Non-Negotiable)

Clients must provide:
- Executive sponsorship
- Timely access to people and data
- Clear decision rights
- Willingness to act on findings

Without these, outcomes are not possible.

---

## Scope Control & Change Management

- Scope changes require explicit agreement
- New work is reprioritized or deferred — not silently added
- Protecting execution quality overrides deal expansion

---

## Success Measurement

Every engagement defines success using:
- Financial impact
- Execution reliability
- Noise and entropy reduction
- Decision clarity and speed
- Capability transfer

If success cannot be measured, the engagement is redesigned or stopped.

---

## Exit Philosophy (The Anchor)

Shank Strategy Ops measures success by:
- Reduced chaos
- Increased client control
- Durable systems and decisions
- Clean exits without dependency

The goal is not to be needed forever.  
The goal is to leave things stronger than we found them — and move on deliberately.
