## Idea 1: Swiss Brutalist Precision

**Design Movement:** Neo-Brutalist meets Swiss International Style

**Core Principles:**
- Raw, honest typography that commands attention
- Stark contrasts between elements — no ambiguity
- Geometric precision with intentional asymmetry
- Information hierarchy through scale, not decoration

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Pure black (#0A0A0A) — Authority, finality
- Secondary: Warm off-white (#F5F2EB) — Approachable expertise
- Accent: Burnt orange (#D4622B) — Decisive action, controlled energy
- The palette reflects "no-nonsense execution" — nothing decorative, everything functional

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric grid with dramatic scale shifts
- Large typography blocks that break conventional boundaries
- Sections that "cut" into each other with hard diagonal dividers
- Content bleeds to edges — no safe margins

**Signature Elements:**
- Oversized monospace numbers for phase indicators
- Thick black borders that frame key content blocks
- Horizontal rules that extend beyond containers

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Interactions feel mechanical and precise — like machinery engaging
- Hover states reveal hidden information through sliding panels
- No bounce, no playfulness — everything moves with purpose

**Animation:**
- Translate animations only (no scale, no rotate)
- Staggered reveals with consistent 50ms delays
- Elements slide in from hard edges, never fade
- Scroll-triggered animations that feel like turning pages in a technical manual

**Typography System:**
- Headlines: Space Grotesk Bold (700) — geometric, authoritative
- Body: IBM Plex Sans (400/500) — technical precision, excellent readability
- Accents: JetBrains Mono — for numbers, labels, and technical callouts

## Idea 2: Executive Noir

**Design Movement:** Art Deco Revival meets Corporate Minimalism

**Core Principles:**
- Sophisticated darkness that conveys exclusivity
- Vertical emphasis and elongated proportions
- Restrained luxury — premium without ostentation
- Negative space as a power statement

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Deep charcoal (#1A1A1F) — Gravitas, depth
- Secondary: Platinum (#E8E6E3) — Refined contrast
- Accent: Antique gold (#C9A962) — Earned prestige, not flashy wealth
- Tertiary: Steel blue (#4A5568) — Analytical precision
- The palette suggests a private boardroom, not a startup pitch deck

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Tall, narrow content columns with generous margins
- Vertical rhythm emphasized through stacked sections
- Content islands floating in dark negative space
- Asymmetric balance — weight on one side, breathing room on the other

**Signature Elements:**
- Thin gold accent lines that frame sections
- Subtle geometric patterns (chevrons, parallel lines) as texture
- Card components with soft inner shadows creating depth

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Interactions feel considered and deliberate
- Hover states add subtle glow effects, like turning on a light
- Transitions are smooth but not slow — confident movement

**Animation:**
- Fade-up reveals with slight parallax depth
- Gold accent lines that draw themselves on scroll
- Subtle scale increases on hover (1.02x max)
- Text reveals character by character for key headlines

**Typography System:**
- Headlines: Playfair Display (600/700) — editorial authority with serifs

- Accents: Libre Franklin (500) — geometric sans for labels and navigation

- Tertiary: Blueprint cyan (#0891B2) — Technical precision, process
- The palette evokes architectural blueprints and strategic documents

**Layout Paradigm:**

- Sections connected by visible "process lines"
- Sidebar navigation that reveals document structure

**Signature Elements:**
- Numbered phases with connecting lines (like a flowchart)
- Margin annotations that provide context
